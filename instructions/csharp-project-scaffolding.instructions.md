# C# Project Scaffolding Instructions

When asked to create, scaffold, or set up a new C# project — including class libraries, console applications, test projects, or any other .NET project type — you must read and follow the skill file located at:

```
skills/csharp-project-scaffolding/SKILL.md
```

Also read the supporting reference and asset files bundled with the skill:

```
skills/csharp-project-scaffolding/references/nuget-packages.md
skills/csharp-project-scaffolding/assets/Program.cs
skills/csharp-project-scaffolding/assets/Worker.cs
```

## When This Applies

Use this skill for any request that involves:

- Creating a new `.csproj` file
- Scaffolding a class library, console app, or test project
- Adding a new project to a Visual Studio solution
- Setting up NuGet packages for a new project

## Required Behavior

Do not begin scaffolding until you have read `SKILL.md` and completed its pre-flight checklist with the user. The skill defines required pre-flight questions, project structure rules, NuGet packages, and build verification steps that must all be followed.
