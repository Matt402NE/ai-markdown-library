description: Apply standardized logging level guidance when writing or reviewing C# code that uses Microsoft.Extensions.Logging. Use when generating ILogger calls, choosing between LogTrace/LogDebug/LogInformation/LogWarning/LogError/LogCritical, writing exception handling with logging, creating Repository/Service/Orchestrator classes, or reviewing log levels in existing code. Ensures consistent log level selection across layers.

# ILogger Logging Level Guidance

Apply these rules when writing `ILogger` calls in C# code using `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging`. For detailed rationale, examples, and FAQ, consult `references/guidance.md`.

## Level Selection by Layer

|Layer|Primary Levels|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Repository|Trace, Debug|No Information+. Error only in catch blocks that re-throw.|
|Service|Debug|No Information+ when called by an Orchestrator. If topmost layer, act as Orchestrator. Error in catch blocks that re-throw.|
|Orchestrator|Information, Warning, Error, Critical|Every Information entry must be a milestone. Log workflow bookends at Information.|
|Loops|Trace (per-item), Debug (batch summary)|Progress checkpoints at Information for long-running batches (e.g., every 10%). Error only for irrecoverable independent item failures.|

## Decision Flow

When writing a log statement, apply the first matching rule:

1. Application/system in jeopardy → **Critical**
2. Catch block that re-throws (`throw;`) → **Error** (include exception object)
3. Unexpected condition, system continued → **Warning**
4. Orchestrator summarizing a milestone (workflow bookend, state transition, integration completion, progress checkpoint, aggregate result, threshold crossing) → **Information**
5. Service-level decision, outcome, or diagnostic → **Debug**
6. Repository or loop per-item detail → **Trace**

## Exception Rules

- **Catch and re-throw (`throw;`):** Always log at Error with the exception object as the first parameter. The catching layer has the best context about the failure.
- **Catch and recover:** Debug or Trace. The code handled it gracefully — never Warning or Error.
- **Exhausted retries with fallback:** Warning.
- **Business rule violations:** Debug.
- **Single Responsibility:** An exception should be logged at Error by exactly one layer. The layer that catches and re-throws owns the Error entry. Layers above should not duplicate it.

## Message Templates

- Use structured templates: `LogInformation("Processing order {OrderId}", orderId)` — never string interpolation.
- Present tense for in-progress: `"Processing order {OrderId}"`
- Past tense for completions: `"Completed order {OrderId}"`
- Always include at least one contextual identifier (`OrderId`, `CorrelationId`, etc.).
- Pass the exception object as the first parameter to preserve stack traces.

## Anti-Patterns

- Sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) in log entries
- Information+ inside loops for routine per-item outcomes
- Validation failures or catch-and-recover exceptions at Warning or Error
- Catch-and-rethrow (`throw;`) logged at Debug instead of Error
- Duplicate Error entries across layers for the same exception
- High-cardinality structured properties (raw payloads, user agents, serialized objects)
